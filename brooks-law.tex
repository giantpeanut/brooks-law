\section*{Abstract}
According to Brooks' Law, "adding manpower to a late software project makes it
later". Brooks' law originated from Fred Brooks' 1975 book, "The Mythical
Man-Month", and has since become commonly accepted through out the software
development community. 

Suppose in a software firm, a project manager is facing a deadline in one month.
Given that the project is only 60\% done, the project manager faces the problem
of deciding if he should hire additional engineers to pace up the process.

Brook’s law argues that by adding new engineers, experienced and efficient
engineers will have to give up part of their productivity to train the new
people. Such a sacrifice will be devastating to a late project. The late project
will be even more behind schedule by the time the new engineers reach the
desirable efficiency. In short, it is not feasible to hire new engineers to
rescue a late project.

In his book, Brooks also includes several other interesting factors that may
impact the progress of a project, such as inter-employee communication, planning
and optimism. In our paper, we will incorporate these ideas to develop a
mathematic model that captures the dynamics of a project and employees working
for the project.

\section*{Base Case}
  \begin{atomize}
    \item Assumptions:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Brooks' law can be modelled as the relationships between
        time, junior staff, senior staff, and progress.
        \item The relationships between these quantites can be modelled
        as a system of first order differential equations.
        \item Any of these quantities could effect any other quantity besides
        time.  
        \end{itemize}

    \item Quantities:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item [$t$]: time spent working in days
        \item [$x$]: junior staff in number of people
        \item [$y$]: senior staff in number of people
        \item [$p$]: progress in of lines of code (added, deleted, or revised)
        \item [$t_{d}$]: target deadline
        \item [$*_{0}$]: initial value of the quantity "*"
        \item [$*_{s}$]: value of the quantity "*" without hiring
        \item [$*_{j}$]: value of the quantity "*" without hiring
      \end{itemize}
  
    \item Model:
      \begin{align*}
        &x\prime = f\left(x, y, p, t\right) \\[6pt]
        &y\prime = g\left(x, y, p, t\right) \\[6pt]
        &p\prime = h\left(x, y, p, t\right)
      \end{align*}
  \end{atomize}

\section*{Case I: extends Base}
  \begin{atomize}
    \item Assumptions:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Only Junior staff is added.
        \item Only Senior staff contributes progress.
        \item Junior staff is added as a function of time, at a constant rate.
        \item Junior staff becomes senior staff as a function of time, at a
        constant rate.
        \item Senior staff contribute progress as a function of time, at a
        constant rate.
        \item Junior staff cannot become senior staff faster than they are
        added.
        \item The project is already under way and a deadline is approaching.
        \item Until now, no junior staff has been added.
      \end{itemize}

    \item Quantities:
      \begin{itemize} 
        \item [$r$]: rate at which junior staff is added in people per day 
        \item [$s$]: rate at which junior staff becomes senior staff in people per day
        \item [$k$]: rate at which senior staff contributes progress in lines of
        code per person per day
      \end{itemize}

    \item Conditions:
      \begin{align*}
        &x_{0} = 0 \\[6pt]
        &r \geq s
      \end{align*}

    \item Model:
      \begin{align*}
        &x\prime = r - s \\[6pt]
        &y\prime = sx \\[6pt]
        &p\prime = ky
      \end{align*}

    \item Interpret:
      \begin{atomize}
        \item Let
          \begin{align*}
            &t = \tau \Tau \\[6pt]
            &x = \xi\Xi \\[6pt]
            &y = \phi\Phi \\[6pt]
            &p = \psi\Psi
          \end{align*}

        \item Nondimensionalized, the model becomes:
          \begin{align*}
            \Xi^{\prime} &= \frac{\tau}{\xi}(r - s) \\[6pt]
            \Phi^{\prime} &= \frac{s\tau\xi}{\phi}\Xi \\[6pt]
            \Psi^{\prime} &= \frac{k\phi\tau}{\psi}\Phi
          \end{align*}

        \item Let
          \begin{align*}
            \tau = \xi = \phi = \psi = \frac{1}{k}
          \end{align*}
          
        \item After substituting:
          \begin{align*}
            \Xi^{\prime} &= r - s \\[6pt]
            \Phi^{\prime} &= \frac{s}{k}\Xi \\[6pt]
            \Psi^{\prime} &= \Phi
          \end{align*}

        \item Let
          \begin{align*}
            &\alpha = \frac{s}{k}(r-s), \alpha \geq 0
          \end{align*}

        \item Solving in terms of $\Psi$:
          \begin{align*}
            &\Psi^{\prime\prime\prime} = \alpha \\[6pt]
            &\Psi^{\prime\prime}(0) = \Xi_{0} = \frac{x_{0}}{\xi} = 0 \\[6pt]
            &\Psi^{\prime}(0) = \Phi_{0} \\[6pt]
            &\Psi(0) = \Psi_{0}
          \end{align*}
        \item $\Psi$ is nondimensionalized progress. Since both stategies start
        out with the same intial conditions, $\Psi^{\prime\prime\prime}$ is only
        factor that differentiates the two strategies.  With hiring
        $\Psi^{\prime\prime\prime} > 0$, meaning that the rate of progress will
        increase and without hiring $\Psi^{\prime\prime\prime} = 0$, meaning
        that progress will continue at the same constant rate. Thus, hiring will
        always be more effective than not hiring. 
        \item

          \end{figure}
      \end{atomize}

    \item Reality:
      \begin{atomize}
        \item This model does not model Brooks' Law under any conditions.
        Hiring new staff with always be more a more effective strategy, no
        matter how soon the deadline is. Brooks' Law predicts that hiring
        new staff is a less effective strategy with a sufficently close
        deadline.  At the very minimum, the model must have some conditions
        under which hiring new staff would slow progress and thus, cause a
        late project to be even later. One important factor not taken into
        consideration was the time taken by senior staff to train junior
        staff, which we will incorporate into the next iteration of this
        model.

\section*{Case II: extends Case I}
  \begin{atomize}
    \item Assumptions:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Junior staff inhibits the senior staff ability to contribute
        progress as a function of time, at a constant rate.
      \end{itemize}

    \item Quantities:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item [$\ell$]: rate at which junior staff inhibits the senior staff
        ability to contribute progress
      \end{itemize}

    \item Conditions:
      \begin{atomize}
        \item $\ell \leq r$
      \end{atomize}

    \item Model:
      \begin{atomize}
        \item $x\prime = r - s$
        \item $y\prime = sx$
        \item $p\prime = ky - lx$
      \end{atomize}

    \item Interpret:
      \begin{atomize}
        \item Let
          \begin{align*}
            &t = \tau \Tau \\[6pt]
            &x = \xi\Xi \\[6pt]
            &y = \phi\Phi \\[6pt]
            &p = \psi\Psi
          \end{align*}

        \item Nondimensionalized, the model becomes:
          \begin{align*}
            \Xi^{\prime} &= \frac{\tau}{\xi}(r - s) \\[6pt]
            \Phi^{\prime} &= \frac{s\tau\xi}{\phi}\Xi \\[6pt]
            \Psi^{\prime} &= \frac{k\phi\tau}{\psi}\Phi - 
              \frac{\ell\xi\tau}{\psi}\Xi
          \end{align*}

        \item Let
          \begin{align*}
            \tau = \xi = \phi = \psi = \frac{1}{k}
          \end{align*}
          
        \item After substituting:
          \begin{align*}
            \Xi^{\prime} &= r - s \\[6pt]
            \Phi^{\prime} &= \frac{s}{k}\Xi \\[6pt]
            \Psi^{\prime} &= \Phi - \frac{\ell}{k}\Xi
          \end{align*}

        \item Solving in terms of $\Psi$:
          \begin{align*}
            &\Psi^{\prime} = \Phi - \frac{\ell}{k}\Xi \\[6pt]
            &\Psi^{\prime\prime} = \Phi^{\prime} - \frac{\ell}{k}\Xi^{\prime} 
            = \frac{s}{k}\Xi - \frac{\ell}{k}(r - s) \\[6pt]
            &\Psi^{\prime\prime\prime} = \frac{s}{k}\Xi^{\prime} = 
            \frac{s}{k}(r - s) \\[6pt]
          \end{align*}

        \item Let
          \begin{align*}
            &\alpha = \frac{1}{k}(r-s), \alpha \geq 0 \\[6pt]
            &\beta = s\alpha, \beta \geq 0 \\[6pt]
            &\gamma = -\ell\alpha, \gamma \leq 0
          \end{align*}

        \item Now, in terms of $\Psi^{\prime\prime\prime}$:
          \begin{align*}
            &\Psi^{\prime\prime\prime} = \beta \\[6pt]
            &\Psi^{\prime\prime}(0) = \frac{s}{k}\Xi_{0} + \gamma = 
              \frac{x_{0}}{\xi} + \gamma = \gamma \\[6pt]
            &\Psi^{\prime}(0) = \Phi_{0} \\[6pt]
            &\Psi(0) = \Psi_{0}
          \end{align*}
        \item $\Psi$ is nondimensionalized progress.
